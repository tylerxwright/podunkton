	Somethings wrong with the way highscores work in the database. It deals
	with referential integrity.
	
	Need to remember that the Users table isn't complete. It lacks character
	details such as hair, skin, etc.
	
	If /engine/Process.php gets too big, its going to need to be split into
	multiple files to reduce the server having to load one huge class.
	
	Comments on nodes still need to work through the forum. I just need to
	figure out the best way to go about doing that.
	
	Things like favoriteGame depend on a reference and to satisfy the zero
	or more condition, a None row is to be inserted as id 1 for Games and
	Toons. I feel like there is a better way to do this though.
	
	Be thinking about a base sql file that can put the system into a standard
	test layout.
	
	I just discovered a sweet new method to make changes to the database. The
	method is located in the Process class and its used in the edit proc. It
	could be possible that I will use this method from here on out!
	
	Change Error class to be called message class and make it just dispatch
	messages in a default way
	
	In the forums, categories and subcategories need a position
	
	In the forum part of the database, subcategory might be changed to topics
	
	Be thinking about ON DELETE CASCADE
	
	Add Category order in the forums as well as on subcategories
	
	Turn the forums into a class
	
	SWF's on site should not be BLOBS, put them in content folder
	
	User page privacy, setting individual fields for friends/members/guests
	
	Item Dow Jones
	
	Albums only have generes Artists genres are based off of their albums
	
	Change Bands to Artists in database
	
	On search bar, when your in a section, it automatically singles out the section
	your currently viewing. So if your in music, music is checked so your able to search
	music...Cool!
