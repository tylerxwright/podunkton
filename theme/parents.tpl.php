			Sounds harsh, huh? Well, the second I get complaints, that's what I'm going to say. While Podunkton.com strives to maintain an environment that is fun and friendly for everyone, we do produce content that may not be suitable for children. Anything we release is clearly marked with a "RATING" to let a user know what to expect from that content. The site is geared for anyone 13 and up, but this is an opinion of our own. As a parent, you will need to decide what is "okay" and what is strictly prohibited in your own home. DO NOT BLAME OUR WEBSITE FOR WHAT YOU ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO WATCH. As I said, this may seem harsh, but its up to you as responsible parents to monitor and allow what your child sees. We've done all we can. Also, in reference to our <a style="color: #647DB8;" href="/legal">TERMS OF USE</a>, if you're child is under 18, then he legally can't be using our site as a member unless you've agreed to it. So please, monitor your children for their safety and ours!! Below is more information for you to help better protect our youth.

		<div class="story_text">
			Take time and ask to view your childs user page sometime. This will help make you aware of what information he/she has posted to the general public. Personal Information is an option on our website, but how much personal information is up to the user. We also do not require it. Therefore, it is in the user's hands what is displayed. We discourage the giving our of phone numbers, etc, but do not monitor it as of now. Be sure to let your child know the dangers this may present.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">What is Welcome to Podunkton?</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Welcome to Podunkton (Podunkton) is an online community, forums, cartoon series, games, and virtual economy website. Anyone can become apart of the community environment, create custom character, earn "Munniez", and purchase items in an immersive experience. The website is meant to be interperated as a small town environment where big things happen.
		</div>
		
		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Who can join the Podunkton community?</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Anyone can join, and its free of charge. Users under 13 may require adult supervision, but the site is geared for teens to adults. Heck, you might be playing on here at work sometime. Quick, the boss is coming!!
		</div>
		
		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Does Podunkton cost money?</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			No. Its free to sign up and participate. Users earn an in site currency called "Munniez" just from being on the site that they can use to purchase items, songs, and other content. There is an option for Monthly Items, which is a small donation fee, as noted on the Monthly Items Page, but this is strictly optional. These Monthly Items are collectibles, and considered rare. They are not to be resold for real money, but on the site, they can be resold for "Munniez", and are typically considered worth more.
				<br/><br/>
			Users also have an option to purchase "Credits". More info can be found on the <a style="color: #647DB8;" href="/faq#f6">HELP/FAQ PAGE</a>. These Credits are a secondary currency that can be used in place of Munniez. Think of it as buying your way to the top instead of spending time on the site and earning it. Either way is fine.
				<br/><br/>
			In the future, we may also offer merchandising for money, but the use of the site will remain free of charge.
