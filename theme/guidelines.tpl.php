		<div class="story_text">
			In the small town of Podunkton, big things happen! That's why we have a set of guidelines... moreso for the do-gooders of the town. If you see something you don't like, YOU have the power! Using the Tolerance System, you can make posts hidden and even get deleted! Its your town, after all. Here's what we're hoping to see very little of. The Podunkton Police Dept probably won't be involved much, as they mostly spend time at the donut shop. These Rules &amp; Guidelines are here to let you know that if we have to get involved, these are things we'd more likely notice that could get you into some trouble. If the Podunkton Police Dept. is writing tickets, they'll be hefty sums!!

			<ul class="rules" style="margin-top: 8px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">
				
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Keep things in their respective categories! If you see something that doesn't fit, ignore it or thumbs down the topic. This will get it removed quicker.</li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Stalking is a problem. If someone is stalking you, block them from your viewables. Use common sense, I shouldn't have to punish someone for you being annoyed, that's just retarded.</li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Sometimes kids get on our site. Try to be pleasant. However, we're not gonna bust you up for swearing. Just keep it Klunk, nah mean?</li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">No illegal stuffs. If you're using our site for something that could get US in trouble, expect us to report your IP and location to the authorities. I'm effing serious. :)</li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Cybering is for losers. If you're gonna pull that crap, I swear, I'm takin' your Munniez and XP. Try me, a-holes. Muhahah!! ULTIMATE POWERS!!! Seriously, don't cyber, thats freakin' lame. Take it to AIM. (Rhymes, teehee!)</li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Don't post malicious links or porn. If I happen to click one, I'll send all the viruses on the internet to your location. We'll find you! </li>
					<li class="rules" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;">Understand that there are a variety of ages on this site. Also, understand that we don't ask for age verification. Everything that may be inappropriate for minors that is created by us is clearly marked as such. Therefore, you, the users, are in charge of creating the kind of experience you want. The colors and shinies on this site appeal to youngsters and retards, as well as people like myself with no lives. BE AWARE. SOMETIMES THIS CREATES A PROBLEM. If we get reports of this kind of thing, or letters from parents, we'll have to enforce more stringent rules and regulations, and enforce more carefully. We'd rather leave it to you all, so please, do your job and filter out the garbage and work together! THANKS!</li>

		<div class="story_text">
			We've taken the liberty to blacklist a variety of questionable sites. We won't tolerate pornography, excessive violence, hate, or malice in the forums. This isn't 4chan, go get your cartoon porn and racism fix there. Keep it PG-13 or relevant when you're here.
		</div>
		
		<br/>
		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">IMAGE TAGS &amp; POSTING</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Yes, we've disabled images in the forums. For now. We're working on a system to prevent problems, but it won't be up for awhile. For now, post a link to a site you know will work.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">REPERCUSSIONS; PENALTIES</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Failure to follow rules and guidelines as listed above may result in nothing. In fact, in most cases, these guidelines are simply that: guidelines. If you're doing something enough to get noticed by us, we may enforce penalties, but this will only be in extreme cases. Also, if you violate the TERMS OF USE, we'll probably jump on that. Things we may be more likely to ruin you for would be:
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Botting:</b> Using an automated script, macro, or refreshing feature to generate XP, Munniez, etc, is not allowed. If we catch you, you're done. Upon suspicion, we will inspect your account and deem appropriate action.
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Hacking:</b> This goes for a person's account or anything else on our website. We've built a fairly secure system, but if someone does hack, we have ways to track that. Depending on the extent of the hacking, we'll enforce repercussions we deem appropriate and possibly further. You don't want legal action. Just leave it alone.
			<br/><br/>
			We have no visible moderators in place, but Big Brother is always watching. If you're causing a problem, we'll make it go away. By using out website, you've already agreed to this, so respect the contract you're in.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">SAFETY</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			For common sense's sake, be sure to protect yourself as well. We'll do our part to make your experience pleasant and safe, but always log off and never give out passwords. Not even our staff will know your passwords, so there is never a time anyone should need it. Keep it safe, and be safe. Never give out information to anyone.
			<br/><br/>
			Keep yourself protected. You never know who's out there. Make friends, but be smart about it. Don't give out your phone numbers or addresses, or any other personal information that may lead to a breach in your safety.
