	<b id="f1">Q: Where am I?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">You have stumbled into the town of Podunkton! Podunkton is a small town in the middle of nowhere where big things happen. Its the biggest little town on the internet!</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f2">Q: What can I do here?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Here in the town of Podunkton you can do a variety of things. First and foremost, this little town is big on community! We've dedicated a whole section to it. In community, you can chat in the forums by making new topics or joining already existing ones. This is the primary feature of community so far. In the forums, you'll earn Munniez to purchase new items for yourself. These items can be equipped to your character or traded with your friends. The possibilities are endless (are they?).<br/><br/> 
There's a world of other things you can do here in Podunkton as well. We welcome you to check out the local musicians in the Audio section, or maybe listen to some stand-up or radio shows. Tune into WDCK for the latest on-goings and gossip, as new shows will air weekly (stay tuned for dates). Perhaps its Cycon and his friends that brought you to our town in the first place. They're quite the bunch. You'll, of course, be able to watch their antics in the Toons section.<br/><br/>
Need to kill some time at your dead end job? No problem! Play the games in our games section.<br/><br/>There's lots to do, so click around, explore, and have fun. This is the town built for you, the community, so use it!</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f3">Q: What are announcements?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Are you brain dead? Didn't you ever go to high school? Okay, okay, so let's assume you didn't. You're here, after all. Announcements are where the higher authorities post what is coming and going in Podunkton. Its your #1 news source for all new things to be had, as well as anything that might have been repaired in town. Consider it like a local newspaper. Small, quaint, to the point, and occasionally it might have something in it about Old MacGregor's chickens getting out of the coop.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f4">Q: What is 'Closed Beta'?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Basically, its an opportunity. For you, that means a sneak peak at what's in the works. For us, it means a bunch of snot nosed punks breaking what's in the works. Nah, seriously, its a chance for us to have you guys test things to find what works, what doesn't work, how can we fix it, and what can we add to make the experience easier and better for you! So consider yourself an important part, as closed beta is a very crucial time. Don't worry, we'll give you something for it if you do a good job!</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f5">Q: What are 'Munniez'?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Munniez are the currency here in Podunkton. They don't cost you a thing to earn, as is most of the website's content. We've tried to create a very free and creative environment, and we welcome everyone to join and earn munniez to buy new items from our small town shops. You can earn Munniez in a variety of ways, but for now, posting in the forums and doing your part around town to keep the community buzzing is all it takes to make a few extra Munz (as dollars are to bucks!).</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f6">Q: What are 'Credits'?(not in BETA)</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Credits haven't been implemented into the economy yet here in Podunkton (we don't have those little credit card swipey machines, AGH!) but eventually credits will be much like a credit card system here in Podunkton. For a small fee, you'll be able to purchase credits directly through Paypal. This will help stimulate the economy, as some items can only be purchased on credits! Think of it as a way to keep the town alive. We still encourage free stuff though, so Credits aren't necessary to get items. That's what trading is for! (make your friend buy them, that b***ard!)</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f7">Q: What's the difference between 'Munniez' and 'Credits'?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Munniez are earned for free, basically. If you do your part around town, you're bound to earn some munniez. They are also the major currency here in Podunkton, so most things are purchased with Munniez (even free downloads? Maybe....). So where does that leave credits? Credits are purchased through Paypal. This is a separate monetary system. Think of it as your in-site credit limit. If you donate a certain ammount of U.S. Dollars to our website, you will be granted a Credits Limit! That means you'll be able to buy items without using your hard earned Munniez. Yeah, it costs a little something to get credits, but it'll help the town out immensely, and you'll be able to purchase items other people won't necessarily have access to. Then, you can sell them for Munniez for whatever cost you want since no one else will have them! Drive up the market value! Credits won't be implemented for a little while, and definately not in Beta.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f8">Q: How do I earn Munniez?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Suck my... wait. Heh heh. Well, the truth is, you'll be able to earn them in many different ways, but for now (and for beta), you'll be posting in the forums. Conversations also have Thumb Ratings, which will give you munniez if you reach a certain threshold (all explained a bit later). So, to earn munniez :<br/>
<ul class="inner">
<li class="inner">Post in the Forums</li>
<li class="inner">Having a higher rated post based on Thumb Ratings</li>
<li class="inner">Earn bonus munniez for high rated posts!</li>
<li class="inner">Page Surfing! (moving from page to page)</li>
</ul>
There will be many more ways to earn munniez, but for now, we'll just rip off some other, not as fun, community town wannabes. >.> 
</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f9">Q: What are Experience Points and what are they for?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Here in Podunkton, you are a citizen! As in any community, some citizens are better than others. Its a hierarchical world! Those citizens who spend more time in their community are often revered as good citizens, so we came up with a way to rate that! Basically, the more experience points you get will eventually add up. When you reach a certain number of experience points, you will level up in citizenship. High leveled citizens might have access to more features and places in town that other, less contributing citizens will not. This way, we can award those of you who take time to better our community with secret areas, VIP parties, special events and items that might require a certain level of citizenship. This separates the women from the girls (we're politcally friendly!).<br/><br/>So, in lamen's terms: Experience points help you level up and be better than someone else, so earn 'em! You never know when it might REALLY matter.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f10">Q: How do I earn Experience Points?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">You will be able to earn experience points in a variety of ways. Much like munniez, experience points are earned from working around town, doing things for the community! Why, just being in town is enough to earn you some experience towards being a better citizen! Here is a list of ways you can earn more experience points:
	<ul class="inner">
<li class="inner">Post in the Forums (duh)</li>
<li class="inner">Rate a post using the Thumbs Ratings</li>
<li class="inner">Time spent actively logged in on the site</li>
<li class="inner">Page Surfing! (moving from page to page)</li>
</ul>
	</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f11">Q: What are Thumb Ratings?(partial in BETA)</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Thumb Ratings are the bread and butter of our moderator free forums. We've put the moderation in the hands of the community. That means, if you see something you don't like or are offended by, etc, its up to you and your posse to shut it down. This is how the real world works, aside from those stupid things they call Laws. We've yet to stick a law system into the town, so we're counting on you guys to create a society you want.<br/><br/>With the Thumb Ratings, you can THUMBS UP or THUMBS DOWN any post in any thread. If you really like someone's post, then you give it a THUMBS UP! If someone is being a moron or offensive, you give them a THUMBS DOWN!<br/><br/>With enough THUMBS UP's, the person that posted the thread will recieve Munniez bonuses for contributing to their community in a positive way, based on what the community wants. If the person gets enough THUMBS DOWN's on a post, they will suffer the consequences! The negatively rated posted will enter two stages of a TOLERANCE SYSTEM.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f12">Q: What is the Tolerance System?(not in BETA)</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">The tolerance system is your way of control in the forums of Podunkton. When a post has recieved enough THUMBS DOWN's, it will enter the first stage of tolerance. In this stage, the post becomes unviewable to the average citizen. That means, when you enter the thread of the post, it will appear only as having been posted by the user who posted it. You will then have the option of clicking the post to view its contents. If you haven't voted yet, you'll be able to vote negatively or positively after viewing it. <br/><br/>The second stage of the tolerance system is removal. If a post recieves enough negative reviews by the community, the post will be removed permanantly from the forums forever. The person will also recieve EVIL points in the community, which has its own repercussions.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f13">Q: How do I get to my User Page?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Here in Podunkton, every citizen is given a User Page! This user page will be your area to publicize info about yourself. There are a variety of options you'll have as far as what you want people to know about your online citizen! Get creative! You'll also have access to quicklinks here on your user page. From here, you'll be able to customize your character with items, start trades, and other things to come. You can also view other citizen's user pages and eventually leave them comments. For now, just drop them a private message. That'll do, pig. That'll do.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f14">Q: How do I get items?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">There are a number of ways to get character and game items. The first and most obvious way is to hit up the Podunkton Shopping Center. There you'll find a variety of mini shops to choose from, and hopefully find the items you're looking for. These items will be purchased with Munniez you've earned while participating in the community. Go wild, you've earned it!<br/><br/>Another way that you'll recieve items is through events, quests, and games. Some of these haven't been added yet, so for now, you'll just have to fend for yourselves and grab up what items you can. We're constantly adding new items, and every so often a shop will advertise its latest shipment.<br/><br/>You'll also be able to trade items with other citizens. This is another way you'll be able to make munniez. Maybe you can set up your own minishop and sell some hard to find items to your friends for rediculous ammounts of munniez. That's what Vallos would do!</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f15">Q: Can I change my physical features?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">Some of them. Your skin tone and eye color is set once you register, at least until the Plastic Surgery Boutique opens up. However, if you're looking for a new hairstyle or to have your eyebrows waxed, head over to the Barbershop. There, you'll be able to choose from any of the hairstyles you had on registration and can change for the price of some munniez. Hey, some of them might not have a high school degree, but stylists gotta eat too, y'know! The same applies for eyebrows.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f16">Q: How do I send a private message?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">There is a link in the top right login box called INBOX that will give you direct access to your message inbox (duh). Here you can compose new messages, read messages you've received, or check messages you've sent to others. You'll be able to reply to messages as well. Messages can be sent to one or more than one user at a time.<br/><br/>Another way to send a message is to click the message icon on a user's post in the forums, or go to their user page and click the link to send them a message.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f17">Q: How do I change the items I'm wearing?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">The quickest way is to click your character up in the top right box. This will take you directly to the edit page. Another way is to go to your user page and click 'Edit Character' in the quick links box to the right of the page. From there, you will be able to edit your character's items based on your inventory.<br/><br/>To equip an item, simply click it, then drag and drop it to the appropriate slot. The slots it can be equipped to will highligh in blue. Items you have equipped will be denoted in your inventory box to the right, while the slots will also show you that an item is equipped.</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f18">Q: How does the Character Editor work?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">An excellent question! As explained above, there are slots on your character that can be filled with items. In the editor, categories are divided up on the top navigation based on where items in those categories can be worn on your character. Choose from Head items, tops, bottoms, etc. If you own items in these categories, they will show up in the right inventory box. Simply click, drag and drop the items to the slots that light up in blue to equip them. They will be denoted in the inventory box as 'equipped'. To unequip something, simply drag it off the slot and back into the invetory box.<br/><br/>Every item has some info, and some items can be leveled up. Item info is displayed after clicking an item in the lower left hand box of the editor. Your character view is displayed in the left viewer box.<br/><br/>Click 'SAVE' before you leave to save your changes. Once you reload the page, all your changes will take effect across the site for all to see! Be on the lookout for small feature changes to the editor!</div>
	<div style="clear: both; width: 792px; height: 20px"></div>
	
	<b id="f19">Q: How does the Trade System work with trading items?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">The Trade System may look a bit complex, but appreciate the complexity, because NOTHING looks complex to a blind person! (If you're blind and reading this, I'm really sorry.) The Trade System works in 4 phases: Trades waiting on your action, trades waiting on their action, change making and confirmation, and completed trades.<br/><br/>Phase 1 are trades you have started but haven't sent out. Anytime you start a trade with someone, it saves that trade in phase 1 until you send out the request. This just allows you to keep people on a list of potential traders in case you wanna trade with them at a later time. This is also where trades from other people show up for you! Thus, waiting on your acton!<br/><br/>Phase 2 trades are trades that have been sent to another person and are awaiting them to send something back. This means that if you send a trade request to someone, you're waiting on them to reply to the trade. Phase 2 is also the phase after you recieve a trade from someone that the trade enters when you send it back. Thus, waiting on THEIR action! (not so complex after all, huh? +2 blind points!)<br/><br/>Phase 3 is the haggle phase. This is where all trades end up if you keep sending them back and forth, perhaps to haggle for a better deal. Here, you can make changes and send new requests on the same trades from before. You can also finalize a trade here and when each person has finalized, it'll move to Phase 4!<br/><br/>Phase 4 is completed trades. This is simply a log of the trades you've completed with other people. It only stores the most recent trades, so if you wanna trade with that person again, you'll know who it was!<br/><br/>At any point in the Trade System, you will have the option to FINALIZE TRADE. This will FINALIZE the trade as it stands. IT WILL NOT MAKE AN OFFER. If you put an item in to trade and click FINALIZE, it won't send your offer, as you did not click to OFFER trade. Finalization can take place at any time in the trade process, and will immediately take the trade into Phase 3 for confirmation or changes.<br/><br/>Good luck on trading!</div>

	<b id="f20">Q: How do I find other citizens?</b> <a class="blue" href="#">return to top</a>
	<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold;">A:</div>
	<div style="float: left; width: 550px;">You can easily find other citizens from town in the forums! This is the best place to interact and communicate with othe people. Here you can build relationships and embark on a glorious adventure with new buddies at your side.<br/><br/>Still not satisfied? Jeesh... Okay, well another way you can find them is search for them in advanced search, or browse through our citizen directory, conveniently in ABC order! (thanks Vallos!)<br/><br/>FOR BETA: Click the gawdy link at the top. Shouldn't be too hard.</div>
