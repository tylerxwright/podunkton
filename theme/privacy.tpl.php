			So college wasn't working out. I needed to either find a new college or take some time off to get my act together. I ended up taking some radio broadcasting training while Tyler and I formulated a plan for our first major flash based website. ProjectDCK.com was going to be our most ambitious project to date, and still stands as a major breakthrough for us as developers. We spent months on it. Drawing the town layouts, figuring out how the navigation worked, learning how to update it, and so on. We spent most of the summer getting it together. Once it released, we put out a few more cartoons and hoped for the best. That site was ad free, which was, in retrospect, a bad idea. We'd finally built a major website and cleaned up the art and production. What was next? Our most popular game to date.
