		<div class="story_text">
			There are many of you out there, wandering the streets of Podunkton who know the facts on how it all began. 
			Many of you don't. Seeing as how I can't discern between the two, I've created this little factoid sheet to fill 
			you in on how we got going and how we're doing.

		<div class="story_text">
			It was roughly the summer of our graduating year, and Tyler (lead programmer) and 
			I had been learning all kinds of new stuff about media that our podunk little high 
			school just didn't have. Heck, they might not have known it existed. We were sitting 
			in Tyler's room one evening when our friend Josh stopped by. Josh is a few years older 
			than we are, so he'd already been in college for a few years. Turns out, he was in some 
			web-based classes that he learned the basics of flash animation and web design. However, 
			this evening, he had come over to learn Lightwave with Tyler. Lightwave is a 3d rendering 
			program. They were experimenting with animating 3d rockets. Just simple 3d animation. I, 
			on the other had, was trying desperately to get Josh to show me some stuff in flash, as 
			I had never previously used it. He basically had no interest in the subject, so I pressed 
			onward on my own as the 3d rockets flew across the screen. Me and my laptop created our 
			very first animation, a blue face drawn with a touchpad saying, "Hey, Everybody!" and looking 
			pretty pathetic. Needless to say, I was hooked. After a summer of playing with flash 
			(and mostly Star Wars Galaxies) Tyler and I went our separate ways for college.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 2: Don't Drink, Don't Smoke, Don't go to Class</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			College was stupid. I had chosen a primarily scientific college since I had intended on med school. 
			The first day I got to Purdue University, I met Mike Fortress, aka Damien. Mike was a great artist, 
			and bested me in every doodle. I was constantly begging him to draw me pictures, to which he politely 
			declined (ignored me....). I ended up spending my first couple weeks in classes, until I realized 
			I wasn't meant to be a doctor and hated Purdue. After that, I spent most of my time in my dorm room 
			on my computer. This was when I started really getting into teaching myself the full mechanics of flash. 
			I'd read what I could find, but mostly I just played around with it. One early animation  included me 
			standing in my dorm room, making some comment, then a giant breast rolled in the door and asked me if I 
			wanted some titty (yeah, shut up, I was still learning!). Mike found this amusing, but nothing really 
			came of flash until about October or November. I was introduced to a website that allowed character creation, 
			something I'm obviously all about. I spent some time on the site, long enough to get involved in the 
			community and start learning who people were. One person stood out though, as her claims in a forum post 
			lead everyone to believe she had terminal brain cancer. I didn't buy it. I called her out and was 
			immediatly hated on since she was well popular. This sparked my first "DCK" cartoon, "Ode to Cigarette". 
			The cartoon immediately turned the viewpoint of her claims on her, and soon, no one bought into it. She 
			was scheduled to die in a couple months. About a year later, she talked to me and called me bad names. I 
			just smiled with a feeling of knowing I was right. Win. (yeah, these days for me were pretty lame, 
			judge on, baby)
		<br/><br/>
			The cartoon had done so well, I decided to press onward with another. 
			"The Wrong Vagina," who's title I've yet to understand, came out and seemed 
			to explode on newgrounds. To date, its still my most viewed cartoon and remains 
			a classic favorite among fans and first timers alike. This lead to a whole new 
			outlook on the flash world and the world of the internet. It was time to expand.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 3: Old Favorites, New Favorites</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Realizing I'd created something that I not only enjoyed, but others seemed to enjoy, I decided 
			it best to press on. Needless to say, by the second year of college, my GPA was suffering, but 
			my views and IMs were through the ROOF. I was on cloud nine. Like most blossoming artists, they 
			tend to let it go to their heads. I was not so different. The big ego-trip came when Legendary 
			Frog, a flash mogol at the time, asked me to be in a collaberation with him. It was during this 
			time I met many artists who taught me alot more about flash. I also learned the value of having 
			some friends who do what you do and keep you level headed about it all. After all, we jsut make 
			obscure cartoons. We're not THAT big, sheesh. So I pressed onward with my flash career and continued 
			making cartoons with others an on my own. Of course, Kory Pratt (Klunk) and Mike were still by my 
			side, getting into it just as much as I was. Mike helped develop our first website about this time, 
			and I think we even had some ads on there and made a little money, which was nice.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 4: Along came a Tyler....</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			So by now, I'd already done a website and cartoons. Learning not only to combine the two for some innovation, but also what else was possible. I quickly found out that Flash Games were a big way to grab some attention, as well as probably the last frontier of 2d gaming. I had to get in on that. I summoned Tyler at some point and wondered what he knew about Flash. At the time, very little. He wasn't absolutely sold on it being valuable, but I convinced him to come on up to Purdue and lets just mess around with it. We did. In that weekend, we created our first flash game, "Splooge Invaders". The art style had also changed, as Mike was doing most of it then. The game did remotely well, but it had alot of things missing and we had alot to learn about making games. We spent the next couple months developing "IM ATTACK!" which was supposed to be a sarcastic rebuttle to all the IMs I was getting. People stopped IMing me after that, oddly enough... HA! Anyway, Purdue wasn't working out for me, and with Tyler being the only one committed to really getting things done, I had to work more closely with him. By the end of the year, it was time to go home and re-evaluate my plans.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 5: The Birth of a Town</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			So college wasn't working out. I needed to either find a new college or take some time off to get my act together. I ended up taking some radio broadcasting training while Tyler and I formulated a plan for our first major flash based website. ProjectDCK.com was going to be our most ambitious project to date, and still stands as a major breakthrough for us as developers. We spent months on it. Drawing the town layouts, figuring out how the navigation worked, learning how to update it, and so on. We spent most of the summer getting it together. Once it released, we put out a few more cartoons and hoped for the best. That site was ad free, which was, in retrospect, a bad idea. We'd finally built a major website and cleaned up the art and production. What was next? Our most popular game to date.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 6: Winding down in Podunk Town</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			After a year or two, the site slowly changed. It finally came down to nothing changing. The system turned out to be overly complicated to update, as well as get everything done we'd hoped to. Our ambition smothered us with ACTUAL work. Its not that we were lazy, just overwhelmed. We'd learned ways to make it better, and were ready to press on, but hadn't had time to totally revamp the entire system. Therefore, we stuck to our roots and decided to make a game. "Drunk Klunk" came out around new years. The game itself took about 2 days total to create, and we mostly did it for something to do. Once released, the game suddenly popped up on every flash gaming site online. The big one for Tyler was Addicting Games. When he saw it, his motivation doubled. We had to get back on the map and do some more things that we just loved, not necessarily something to be popular. It was around this time the original concepts for "Podunkton.com" began to unfold. Many nights were spent discussing the possibilities, however, we didn't have the knowledge to build most of it. We let our ambition linger, until 2007.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 7: You Can't Hold Back Ambition, its like diarrhea!!</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			Tyler had finished up college and was a programming whiz. I had learned as much as I could about flash and actionscript, as well as website layouts and development. Plots and background stories had been written. We had a series. It was inevitable that the ambition finally leaked out. We moved into a small, carpetless apartment with two rooms and started planning "Welcome to Podunkton" and the massive user website that you now see. We spent countless sleepless hours with redbull, woring, thinking, writing. Then we started a band, which postponed everything for a year, until we had a drunken stand-off in the parkinglot behind a bar that left Tyler saying he'd go get a job far away unless I pulled the project together. I did. We established Podunkton Studios, LLC as a business in the summer of 2008, and Tyler and I were the company heads. We then pressed forward as hard as we could to get this Podunkton.com website idea done and out there.

		<br/>
		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">CHAPTER 8: Welcome to Podunkton, Podunkton.com</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			As we spent the summer in an apartment with no AC, we worked our hardest and fastest ever. The culmination of all we'd been through with ProjectDCK lingered in our minds, but our motives had changed. We wanted nothing more than to see a dream of ourse realized. As we've pressed on, everything has changed. We're more organized, more on top of things. It was unreal that we'd come this far on ambition, and the series and website had been achieved. We've always got more ideas and we're always pressing forward. I think one thing that will never change is that we'll always be doing something, regardless of who's watching, and that's a good feeling.

		<div class="title_text2" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">FINAL CHAPTER: Conclusion</div>
		<div class="story_text">
			In conclusion, I think its all about overcoming the obstacles. That's something we're dedicated to. We seldom tell ourselves that something can't be done. We'll find a way, or a hack. That's part of our mantra, I think.
		<br/><br/>
			The big thing I say to ann independent developers or artists is that you can never stop. We've been kicking at this dead horse since it started, and all the kicking lead us to the discovery of glue, so now we can hold stuff together and build whatever we want. We support the little guys and we wanna make sure that we're doing what we can for those who can't. We also like smiles. And laughs. 
		<br/><br/>
			We have always been striving to do something big, but we'll always just be an independent company dedicated to that ideal. We do what we want, how we want, and we hope it does some good.
